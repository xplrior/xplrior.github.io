# About

My name is Lukas, and I am your CICD, Support, and Documentation guy. With CICD, I like to make things simple, easy, and user-friendly. I also support others with what I know and enjoy learning new things that interest me. Best of all, I like to document my findings to help others understand what is going on. You can find out more on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasgoodfellow/).

That is the gist of my professional career, but I am usually not that technical when off the clock. I like to travel, experience new things, and do photography. I tend not to be in front of a screen that often outside of work. I have a TV, and that may get used once every other week.

## Personal Goals 2021

This year I have a few personal goals that I wanted to complete.

- Become credit card debt free (6k to go)
- Read 6 books (3 more to go)
- Improve my mobile photgraphy (Photo posts Comming Soon)
