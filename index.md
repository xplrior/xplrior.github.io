# About

I am an IT Professional working in the CI/CD space related to Containers, Kubernetes, and GitOps. I help make things simple, easy, and user-friendly for my customers and colleagues. I mainly do this by documenting my findings, procedures, and tips so others can understand what's going on and save time. I am also known as the documentation guy on my team because I have revamped and contributed to internal and external documentation.

Currently, I am self-learning to be a developer. Starting with making python scripts, I am helping improve my team's automation by taking in feedback from manual processes and figuring out how to automate them. Next, I want to make an application or web application for my team to use.

That is the gist of my professional career and future goals, but I am usually not that technical when off the clock. I prefer not to look at a screen after work and get out. I have a TV, but most of the time, it is never on unless others are over. So what do I do after work, if not in front of a screen? Well, I like to travel and explore new places, go hiking, visit a new national/state park, try a new restaurant, or go to an everyday spot. A hobby I got into is iPhone photography. I am using Instagram as a way I can "document" my experiences and travels. Also, a way to show my skills with taking photos.
